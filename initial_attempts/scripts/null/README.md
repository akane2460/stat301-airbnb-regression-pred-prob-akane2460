## Regression Prediction Problem: Initial Attempts Scripts Null

In this folder contains the scripts for initial attempts based on the null model

### Folders
- `fits_best_params` contains the fits and obtaining of best parameters for each model type as specified by their tuned result in the folder `tunings`

### Scripts
- `2a_ensemble_res_null.R` includes the further specification of the components of the ensemble model for the null recipe
- `2b_ensemble_fit_null.R` includes the fitting of the components of the ensemble model for the null recipe
  **Note** these ensemble scripts serve mostly as a way to gather which models contribute most to the overall final models. They are not standalone models and are merely here for reference.
